# Welcome!
Project Megalo is another one of my crazy projects (ok this one isnt as crazy as Francium, you should check that out too!).
It is a full stack application that uses the PERN (Postgres, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

This project would probably be considered a mini one, since it is just a file uploader.

## Purpose
Don't you find it troubling when you hit that 15GB maximum on your google drive? Me too!
So, I created Project Megalo as a "home server" for my personal files.
This allows people to easily upload files onto my computer without the hassle of connecting cables or using cloud storage.
Since I have extra storage to spare on my hard disk, I see this as an absolute win.
